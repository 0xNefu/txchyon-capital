We're currently earning **28.1% annualized** on a $420k delta-neutral position on Aster — and you can copy it in under 5 minutes.

### The Setup (Live as of Nov 24, 2025)
- Short 1,800,000 $AST/USDT perpetuals @ $1.237 (margin: 420k USDT)  
- Long 340,000 $AST spot (via Meteora DLMM pool)  
- Net delta: ~0.03 (essentially flat)  
- Current funding rate: **+0.076% / 8h** → **28.1% APR** paid to shorts  

### Why This Works Right Now
Aster is in heavy contango. Whales are long perps → funding flows to shorts → we collect while staying market-neutral. With $0.52B open interest and $0.26B TVL, liquidity is unmatched.

### Step-by-Step (Copy-Paste)
1. Go to [asterdex.com](https://asterdex.com)  
2. Open AST/USDT perpetual  
3. Short with 5–10x leverage  
4. Buy equal notional AST spot on Meteora (tightest DLMM bin)  
5. Rebalance every 48h if delta > 0.1

Current PnL from funding alone: **+$2,940 this week**

This is the highest risk-adjusted real yield in DeFi right now.
