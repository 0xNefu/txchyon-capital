# How to Farm 28%+ Yield on Aster Perps Without Directional Risk (Delta-Neutral Funding Strategy)

Aster's perpetuals market is currently in heavy contango, with longs paying shorts **+0.076% every 8 hours** — that's **28.1% annualized** for pure funding collection.

This is one of the cleanest, lowest-risk yield strategies in DeFi right now. No directional bets, no liquidation risk, just collecting payments from over-leveraged longs while staying market-neutral.

In this guide, we'll break down the exact mechanics, step-by-step execution, and why this setup works in November 2025. Anyone with $1k–$1M can copy it in under 5 minutes.

## The Mechanics: Why Aster Funding is Printing Right Now

Aster's perp market is structurally long-heavy, with OI (open interest) at **$520M** (ATH) and daily volume at **$1.42B**. Whales are piling into AST/BTC/SOL longs expecting Solana's Q4 rally, but this creates the perfect funding arb.

**The core idea:**
- Short AST perps on Aster (collect funding from longs)
- Long AST spot on Meteora (hedge the directional risk)
- Rebalance delta every 48 hours → net flat exposure, pure funding yield

**Current setup (November 24, 2025):**
- 8h funding rate: **+0.076%** (longs pay shorts)
- Annualized: **28.1% APR**
- OI: **$520M** (up 240% since September)
- TVL: **$260M** (Meteora AST pools up 380% in 30 days)
- Slippage: **0.29% for $1M SOL-PERP** (deepest on Solana)

This isn't theoretical — it's live on-chain. Cumulative funding paid to shorts on Aster since October: **$28.4M**.

## Step-by-Step: Copy This Strategy in 5 Minutes

### 1. Fund Your Aster Account
- Go to [Aster DEX](https://www.asterdex.com/en/referral/6814be) (use this link for 10% fee rebate + airdrop points)
- Connect your Solana wallet (Phantom, Backpack, etc.)
- Deposit USDT or SOL (start with $1k–$10k for testing)

### 2. Open the Short Perp Position
- Navigate to Perps → AST/USDT pair
- Switch to **Pro Mode** (for precise leverage)
- Short AST/USDT with **5–10x leverage** (e.g., $10k margin for $50k–$100k notional)
- Entry price: Current spot (~$1.237)
- Hold for at least 8 hours to collect first funding payment

### 3. Hedge with Spot Long on Meteora
- Open Meteora DLMM pool (Aster's liquidity partner)
- Buy equal notional AST spot (e.g., $50k–$100k worth)
- Choose the tightest bin for minimal impermanent loss
- This hedges your perp short → net delta ~0.03 (essentially flat)

### 4. Monitor & Rebalance
- Check delta every 24–48 hours on Aster dashboard
- If delta > 0.1, rebalance by adjusting spot or perp size
- Funding payments auto-accrue to your wallet every 8 hours
- Weekly PnL: Expect **+0.5–0.8%** from funding alone

### 5. Exit When Funding Turns Negative
- Monitor 8h rate — if it flips to -0.05% or lower, unwind
- Close perp short, sell spot long → pocket the yield
- Current horizon: 3–6 months (until Solana rally flips the funding)

## Why This Works in November 2025 (On-Chain Data)
Aster's perp market is in **extreme contango**:
- **Funding skew**: +0.076% / 8h → longs over-leveraged, shorts get paid
- **OI skew**: 72% long / 28% short → structural imbalance
- **Volume skew**: 68% retail longs → whales quietly shorting for funding

Compare to competitors:
- Drift: +0.019% funding (weaker arb)
- Hyperliquid: -0.008% funding (shorts paying longs — avoid)

Aster's insurance fund ($41M) and TVL ($260M) mean zero liquidation risk for hedged positions.

## Risk Management (Don't Skip This)
- **Delta drift**: Rebalance if >0.1 (use Aster's built-in calculator)
- **Impermanent loss**: Meteora DLMM bins minimize this (<0.5% over 48h)
- **Funding flip**: Exit if rate turns negative (set alerts on Aster app)
- **Counterparty**: Aster's orderbook is fully on-chain, MEV-resistant

Start small ($1k) to test — scale once comfortable.
