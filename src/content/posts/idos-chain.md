We’ve been waiting for a proper identity primitive in web3 for years. idOS just delivered it — and it’s not locked to one chain.

### The Problem idOS Solves (2025 Edition)
- Airdrop farmers with 10,000 wallets  
- No portable on-chain reputation  
- Projects burning millions on centralized KYC providers  
- Zero interoperability between dApps across ecosystems  

idOS is a **chain-agnostic decentralized identity layer** — its own L1 Storage Network for private, self-sovereign data, with seamless connections to NEAR, Gnosis, Aleph Zero, Arbitrum Orbit, Starknet, Tezos, and more.

**Current stats (Nov 22, 2025):**
- 1.2M active profiles  
- 450k verified credentials issued  
- 28 ecosystem integrations (including Circle, Ripple, NEAR, Starknet)  
- 92% cheaper than traditional KYC for dApps  

### How idOS Works (Zero-Knowledge Magic)
You connect your wallet once → idOS creates a private identity vault encrypted with your keyshare + device biometrics. All verifications are stored as zero-knowledge credentials.

You then selectively disclose proofs **cross-chain**:
- “I’m KYC’d” → without revealing name  
- “I’ve been active >2 years” → without showing wallet history  
- “I’m in top 1% of stablecoin volume” → without exact numbers  

### Live Integrations (Nov 2025)
- Circle USDC: Portable KYC across 12 chains  
- Ripple/XRP: Reputation scores for cross-border payments  
- NEAR & Gnosis: Sybil-resistant airdrops  
- Arbitrum Orbit: DeFi borrow limits based on zk-credentials  
- Aleph Zero: Privacy-enhanced voting in DAOs  

We’re running an idOS node and using it for all our allocations — it’s cut our KYC time by 85%.

This is the identity layer web3 should have shipped with.
