You haven’t heard of iopn yet — and that’s exactly why it’s the best risk/reward in crypto right now.

### What iopn Actually Is (2025 version)
iopn is a decentralized, high-performance RPC + compute layer purpose-built for autonomous AI agents on Solana.

**Current stats (Nov 23, 2025):**
- 1.8M daily agent transactions  
- 42,000 active agents deployed  
- 2.7ms average finality  
- 68% cheaper than centralized RPCs for agent workloads  
- Fully on-chain proof system via zkLogin + TEE  

### Why We’re Accumulating Below $0.40
1. Every major AI agent project launching in Q4 2025–Q1 2026 is quietly migrating to iopn infra.  
2. Revenue accrual model: **30% of all agent fees go straight to $IOPN stakers**.  
3. Current FDV: ~$312M — still sub-$500M while doing **$1.2M monthly revenue**.  
4. Supply locked: **78% of circulating supply staked**.  

We’ve been buying the dip every day since $0.28 and will continue until mainnet v2 ships (expected Jan 2026).

**Position:** Long $IOPN spot + running 3 validator nodes.

The AI agent meta hasn’t even started. iopn is the pick-and-shovel play.
