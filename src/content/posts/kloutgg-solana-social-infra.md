KloutGG just crossed **420,000 verified Solana wallets** — and almost nobody is talking about it.

### What Klout Actually Measures
Your Klout score is calculated from **40+ on-chain signals**:
- Volume traded (weighted by venue)  
- Liquidity provided  
- Governance participation  
- NFT floor ownership  
- DeFi protocol seniority  

No bots. No fake followers. Pure on-chain truth.

### Current Use Cases (Live Nov 2025)
- **Backpack:** Klout 80+ = instant whitelist for all drops  
- **Tensor:** Top 5% Klout = fee rebate  
- **Marginfi:** Higher borrow limits  
- **Pump.fun:** Top 1% Klout = early access to new launches  

### Our Klout Play
We’re in the **top 0.3% globally (Klout 94)** — purely from on-chain volume and longevity.

We expect Klout score to become the primary signal for:
- Token allocations  
- Alpha group access  
- Job offers in crypto  

It’s the reputation layer Solana desperately needed.
