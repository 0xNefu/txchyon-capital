## ðŸš€ Top 8 DEXs for Lowest Fees and Highest Rewards Right Now

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are the backbone of DeFi, offering a non-custodial way to trade, lend, and earn. Finding the perfect balance between **low trading fees** and **high yield farming or staking rewards** is key to maximizing your crypto gains.

Here are the top 8 DEXs that currently offer the best combination of cost efficiency and lucrative passive income opportunities.

### 1. PancakeSwap (Best for Earning Yield on BNB Chain)

PancakeSwap is the dominant DEX on the **BNB Chain (formerly Binance Smart Chain)** and an excellent choice for yield hunters.

| Feature | Details | Why it Ranks Highly |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fees** | Low trading fees, typically **0.20% to 0.25%**. | Extremely cost-effective for frequent trading on a high-throughput chain. |
| **Rewards** | Extensive yield farming and staking pools with highly competitive **APYs/APR**. | The native **CAKE** token powers an extensive rewards system, making it ideal for earning yield. |
| **Ecosystem** | Offers Swaps, Liquidity Pools, Initial Farm Offerings (IFOs), and an NFT Marketplace. | A comprehensive platform for both trading and earning passive income. |

### 2. Curve Finance (Best for Low-Fee Stablecoin Swaps)

If you primarily trade stablecoins or wrapped assets, Curve is a non-negotiable choice. Its unique Automated Market Maker (AMM) design minimizes slippage.

| Feature | Details | Why it Ranks Highly |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fees** | Ultra-low trading fees, as low as **0.04%** for stablecoin pools. | Specialized AMM ensures near-zero slippage and minimal cost for stable-to-stable swaps. |
| **Rewards** | Highly optimized yield farming pools, especially for stablecoins. | Liquidity Providers can earn fees plus boosted rewards by staking their native **CRV** token (via veCRV). |
| **Specialty** | Deep liquidity for pegged assets like USDC, USDT, DAI, and wBTC. | The go-to DEX for de-risking positions and maximizing returns on stablecoin liquidity. |

### 3. Uniswap (Best Overall & High Liquidity)

As the most popular and liquid DEX, Uniswap (primarily v3 and v4) is an indispensable part of the DeFi landscape, offering innovative features like concentrated liquidity.

| Feature | Details | Why it Ranks Highly |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fees** | Variable fee tiers (**0.01% to 1%**) depending on the pool. | The concentrated liquidity model allows for better capital efficiency, translating to lower effective trading costs and higher fee rewards for LPs. |
| **Rewards** | Liquidity providers can potentially earn significantly **higher APY** due to concentrated liquidity. | By focusing capital in specific price ranges, LPs can capture more trading fees than traditional AMMs. |
| **Liquidity** | The highest Total Value Locked (TVL) guarantees minimal slippage on major token pairs. | The undisputed market leader in volume and available assets. |

### 4. Raydium (Best for Solana's Speed and Low Cost)

Raydium is a cornerstone of the **Solana** ecosystem, combining an on-chain order book with an AMM.

| Feature | Details | Why it Ranks Highly |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fees** | Typically **0.25%** swap fee, with a small portion going to the order book. | Leverages Solanaâ€™s fast finality and negligible gas fees, making the total transaction cost extremely low. |

| **Unique** | Hybid AMM and Order Book model. | Provides the depth of an order book alongside the convenience of a liquidity pool swap. |

### 5. dYdX (Best for Derivatives and Perpetual Contracts)

While most DEXs focus on spot trading, dYdX is a specialized platform for professional traders, offering perpetual contracts with leverage.

| Feature | Details | Why it Ranks Highly |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fees** | **Tiered maker/taker fees** that can be very low, starting near **0.05%** and dropping with volume. | Built on a Layer-2 solution (or its own blockchain), transactions have near-instant execution with minimal gas fees. |
| **Rewards** | Offers trading rewards programs and staking opportunities on its native token. | Attracts active traders who can earn rebates based on their volume. |
| **Focus** | Decentralized derivatives, margin trading, and perpetual futures. | Ideal for high-volume, advanced traders seeking a non-custodial derivatives platform. |

### 6. Aerodrome / Velodrome (Best for Base/Optimism Ecosystems)

Aerodrome (on Base) and Velodrome (on Optimism) use a unique "ve-token" model to incentivize liquidity and trading, known as the "ve-DAO" model.

| Feature | Details | Why it Ranks Highly |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fees** | Low trading fees that are typically competitive with other Layer-2 solutions. | Operating on high-speed, low-cost Layer-2s ensures affordable transactions. |
| **Rewards** | High emission-based rewards for liquidity pools, directly controlled by ve-token holders. | The vote-escrow model allows users to lock tokens for voting rights and to earn a greater share of protocol fees and emissions. |
| **Innovation** | "Bribes" for voting on which pools receive token emissions. | LPs in popular pairs can receive outsized rewards funded by other protocols looking to attract liquidity. |

### 7. 1inch (Best for Aggregated Liquidity and Price Discovery)

1inch isn't a single exchange, but a DEX aggregator that splits your trades across multiple DEXs to find the absolute best price and lowest overall cost.

| Feature | Details | Why it Ranks Highly |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fees** | **Zero trading fees** for the swap itself; you only pay the gas fee and the liquidity provider fee of the underlying DEX. | By routing through multiple sources (Uniswap, SushiSwap, Curve, etc.), it guarantees the best effective rate, minimizing slippage and maximizing savings. |
| **Rewards** | Liquidity provided to 1inch's own pools, plus staking rewards for its native **1INCH** token. | It offers its own rewarding pools while simultaneously being the best tool for all other DEXs. |
| **Efficiency** | Optimizes for gas usage and best price execution. | The single best way to execute a large trade across the DeFi ecosystem. |

### 8. SushiSwap (Best for Multi-Chain Deployment and Community Focus)

A venerable and community-focused DEX, SushiSwap has successfully expanded its pools and rewards across numerous blockchains.

| Feature | Details | Why it Ranks Highly |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **Rewards** | Features yield farming, staking (xSUSHI), and innovative features like Trident pools. | Strong and diversified rewards on multiple chains, making it flexible for users across Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, and more. |
| **Reach** | True multi-chain presence. | Offers users a familiar interface and rewarding structure across nearly every major DeFi ecosystem. |

**Disclaimer:** The decentralized finance (DeFi) space is highly dynamic. Reward APYs/APRs can fluctuate dramatically based on market conditions, token prices, and protocol updates. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) before committing funds to any DeFi protocol. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
